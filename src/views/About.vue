            This website is meant to show my general understanding of HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript. This website is itself an example of a Vue.js web
            app. The front end presentation should speak for itself, but what I
            was unable to demonstrate with this website was my knowledge of
            Node.js and SQL. I have built websites that use the Vue.js frontend
            framework along with Axios.js to connect to an Express.js (Node.js
            web server) application. I use a MySQL module within my Express
            application to connect to a MySQL database API that I run on my
            local computer.
          </p>

            My understanding and knoweldege of JavaScript data structures and
            SQL allows me to be able to build complex web applications that can
            dynamically create and update data. I taught myself how to use
            Vue.js in order to better apply dynamic JavaScript functionality to
            edit and manipulate data within the web applications I build. I am
            working here with free online wervices, specifically Netlify, which
            has Vue.js publishing capabilities, so I have not been able to
            publish a website that has database software installed because I do
            not own a domain. If cost was not a variable, I would publish a web
            application with a Vue.js frontend, an Express.js and Node.js API,
            and a MySQL backend. All of which I know how to develop and create
            on my local machine. Given my general understanding of SQL, I can
            work with other RDBMS software such as Postgres or MariaDB, but on
            my local machine I prefer to run MySQL because of the Node.js
            modules available for installation with NPM (Node Package Manager).
