            This website is meant to show my general understanding of HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript. The front end presentation should speak for itself,
            but what I was unable to demonstrate with this website was my
            knowledge of Node.js and MySQL. I have built websites that use the
            Vue.js frontend framework along with Axios.js to connect to an
            Express.js (Node.js web server) application. I use a MySQL module
            within my Express application to connect to a MySQL database API
            that I run on my local computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            My understanding and knoweldege of JavaScript data structures and
            SQL allows me to be able to build complex web applications that can
            dynamically create and update data. I taught myself how to use
            Vue.js in order to better apply dynamic JavaScript funstionality to
            edit and manipulate data within the web applications I build. Again,
            I am working here with online wervices so I have not been able to
            publish a website database software installed because I do not own a
            domain. If I could, I would publish a web application with a Vue.js
            frontend, an Express.js and Node.js API, and a MySQL backend. All of
            which I know how to develop and create on my local machine.
