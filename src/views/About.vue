            This website is meant to show my general understanding of HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript. The front end presentation should speak for itself,
            but what I was unable to demonstrate with this website was my
            knowledge of Node.js and MySQL. I have built websites that use the
            Vue.js frontend framework along with Axios.js to connect to an
            Express.js (Node.js web server) application. I use a MySQL module
            within my Express application to connect to a MySQL database API
            that I run on my local computer.
          </p>

            My understanding and knoweldege of JavaScript data structures and
            SQL allows me to be able to build complex web applications that can
            dynamically edit and update data. I taught myself how to use Vue.js
            in order to better apply dynamic properites to edit and create data
            within the web applications I build.
